## Project Week 5 Homework

**Note: This homework assumes you've already done the homework for week 4. If you haven't, please go [here](week4.md) to finish that first.**

## Learning goals

By doing this week's homework you'll learn how to:

- Use `GIT branching`
- Learn the `basics of Scrum`
- Work collaboratively from a `single remote repository`
- Make use of `GitHub Boards to keep track` of things
- Work collaboratively on the `same branch`
- How to work with different `npm packages`

## Feature Time!

From this week on you'll be working on certain features, collaboratively. This will be done in a shared repository, that everyone in the group will make a branch to.

The class will be split in groups of two. Each pair will work on a feature. The list of features will be provided by the teacher in class.
