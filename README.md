# Project

Welcome to the Project module! Congratulations on making it this far!

In the upcoming 7 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you will have created a full-stack web application and published it to the internet.

Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice. We will start out with the basics and incrementally add more complexity. This way you'll learn how all the pieces of a RESTful API fit together, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of where the backend stops and frontend starts.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is just as important, because you need to be able to communicate your ideas and efforts in an easy-to-understand manner.

## Learning Goals

During the Project you will work on your technical and communication skills. At the end of this module you'll have to learned the following:

Technical skills:

- How to `build a complete full-stack application`
- Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to each other
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to work with `GIT in a team setting`
- How to write `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of your project's progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`

## Project Outline

In the following table you'll see the outline for each week. Notice how you'll be working on both the technical and communication sides of the project.

## Preparation before your first class

Before you start your first class you're expected to setup a basic project structure. This includes setting up the server, as well as creating a basic client.

Read the [following](documentation/guide-newproject.md) in order to setup your basic folder structure.

**Please do this before your first class on Sunday!**
